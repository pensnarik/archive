# General provisions

1. File is identified by its md5 hash. Thefore, there are [known examples](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/1434/are-there-two-known-strings-which-have-the-same-md5-hash-value) of md5 hash collision. We have
to think to switch to `sha256`.
2. File might be included in another file (archive, encrypted tar, etc.)
3. There is a FUSE driver, written in Python that allows to navigate files by EXIF date or
EXIF Make/Model.
4. Files in archives are processed recursively. Currently supported archive formats are: gz, xz, zip and rar.
5. If file has multiple copies all original file names are stored in the database.

# REST API

Files should be added/updated/removed from archive via HTTP REST API.

## Adding new files

```
POST https://archive-service.parselab.ru/api/add
```

See `upload.sh` for an example. JSON data generated by `preproc.py` should be provided in HTTP request body. JSON
data example for this readme as the following:

```json
{
  "1d010435c7c92dbff73bc067a0c4cf01": {
    "filename": "README.md",
    "size": 1103,
    "ctime": 1561518708.027529,
    "mtime": 1561518708.027529,
    "filetype": "text"
  }
}
```

## Checking files

```
POST https://archive-service.parselab.ru/api/check/<hash>
```

Checks whether file with a given hash exists in the database.

# TODO

1. pcp hash calculation for animated GIFs. `convert` produces multiple images for animated GIFs,
how to calculate pcp hash for them?
